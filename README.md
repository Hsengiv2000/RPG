# RPG
A 2.5D RPG game done in LIBGDX, JAVA
 This game was made in my 9th-10th grade. The mechanics are in place but levels can be added and designed without restrictions, using Tiled Map editor. Some of the art is home made, while the others are from opengameart or Kenny's game art. Sounds are from free online sources as well. Inspired by the modern Pokemon games.
